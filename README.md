# atlas-sync-action

A GitHub Action for syncing a migration directory to [Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.cloud).

## Usage

as its purpose is to persist the desired state of your migration directory.

To use this action, you must first have a token with permissions to write to your
account. To create it:

- Navigate to the Settings page and select the Bots tab. 
- Create a new bot and then create a new token for it, copy the token.
- Add this token as a secret to your repository, named `ATLAS_CLOUD_TOKEN`.

Then, in your workflow, add the following step:

```yaml
name: Sync Atlas Migrations
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Only run on our main branch
jobs:
  gen:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: atlasgo/atlas-sync-action@v0
          with:
            dir: path/to/migrations
            driver: mysql # or: postgres | sqlite
